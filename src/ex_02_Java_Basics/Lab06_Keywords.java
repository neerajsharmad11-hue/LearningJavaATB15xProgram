        Keywords are reserved words that have a predefined meaning in the language;
        you cannot use them as names for variables, classes, or methods.
        Keywords always in small letters
        Examples - package, class, public, static, void
     Complete List of Java Keywords (Categorized)
     1. Data Type Keywords
     byte, short, int, long: Primitive data types for integers.
     float, double: Primitive data types for floating-point numbers.
     char: Primitive data type for a single character.
     boolean: Primitive data type for true or false values.
     void: Indicates that a method does not return any value.
     2. Flow Control & Looping Keywords
     if, else: Used for conditional branching.
     switch, case, default: Used for multi-way branching.
     for, while, do: Used for looping.
     break: Exits a loop or a switch statement.
     continue: Skips the current iteration of a loop.
     return: Exits a method and optionally returns a value.
     3. Exception Handling Keywords
     try: Defines a block of code to be tested for exceptions.
     catch: Catches and handles exceptions generated in the try block.
     finally: Defines a block of code that will always execute, regardless of whether an exception occurred.
     throw: Used to explicitly throw an exception.
     throws: Declares the exceptions a method might throw (method signature).
     4. Access Modifiers
     public: Accessible from anywhere.
     private: Accessible only within its own class.
     protected: Accessible within its own package and by subclasses.
     default (not a keyword, but implied): Accessible only within its own package.
     5. Class, Object, and Method Related Keywords
     class: Used to declare a class.
     interface: Used to declare an interface.
     enum: Used to define a fixed set of constants.
     extends: Used to indicate that a class inherits from another class.
     implements: Used to indicate that a class implements an interface.
     new: Used to create new objects.
     this: Refers to the current object instance.
     super: Refers to the parent class object.
     instanceof: Checks if an object is an instance of a specific class or interface.
     static: Indicates that a member (variable or method) belongs to the class itself, rather than to instances.
     final: Makes a variable constant, a method non-overridable, or a class non-inheritable.
     abstract: Used to declare abstract classes or methods (must be implemented by a subclass).
     native: Indicates that a method is implemented in platform-native code (e.g., C/C++).
     synchronized: Controls thread access to a method or block (thread safety).
     volatile: Ensures a variable is always read from and written to main memory (not thread cache).
     transient: Indicates that a variable should not be serialized.
     6. Package Control Keywords
     package: Defines the package a class belongs to.
     import: Used to import a package or class into the current source file.
     7. Reserved Literals (Not keywords, but reserved)
     true, false: Boolean literals.
     null: Represents a null reference.
     8. Unused/Reserved for Future Use
     const, goto: These are reserved but not used in Java. Use final instead of const.
